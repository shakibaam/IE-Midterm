# Name Gender Prediction Website

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a website that predicts the gender of a given name. The website provides two modes: one where users can input the gender information for a name and store it, and another where users can request the gender prediction through a GET request. The predicted result is displayed in JSON format and should be converted to a JavaScript object.

## Workflow

In this project, the website follows the following workflow:

1. The user wants to find the gender of the name "Hassan".
2. The user enters the name "Hassan" in the specified field and initiates the prediction process.
3. The predicted gender result is displayed, and the user can choose to store it if desired.

1. The user wants to find the gender of the name "Hassan" but assumes it is male.
2. The user enters the name "Hassan" in the specified field and initiates the prediction process.
3. The predicted gender result is displayed, but the user prefers to manually set the gender as male for this name.

### Submit

1. The user wants to find the gender of the name "Hassan" but has previously entered and stored the result.
2. The user enters the name "Hassan" in the specified field and initiates the prediction process.
3. The predicted gender result is displayed, along with a note indicating that the result has been previously saved for this name.
4. The user can modify or delete the stored result.
